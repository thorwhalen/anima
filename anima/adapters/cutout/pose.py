"""Pose: a snapshot of property values to apply to a scene graph.

A pose is the universal output of animation evaluation. Channels evaluate to
a (target, property, value) triple; clips collect them into a `Pose`; the
timeline merges multiple clips' poses; finally `apply_pose` mutates the scene
graph.
