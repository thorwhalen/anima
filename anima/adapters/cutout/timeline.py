"""Timeline: tracks of placed clips with absolute times and blend ramps.

A `Timeline` is a flat description of *what plays when*. It's the canonical
form passed downstream to the JS runtime in Phase 2B. Authoring composition
trees from `anima.ir.compose` (sequence/parallel/etc.) get *flattened into* a
Timeline by `compile_shot` (see `compile.py`).

Evaluation semantics in Phase 2A:

- For each track, identify all clips active at time ``t``.
- Each active clip produces a `Pose`.
- Clips on **the same track** override each other in start-order (later wins).
- Clips on **different tracks** merge with later-track override semantics
  (track order in the list determines priority — last track wins on conflict).
- ``blend_in`` and ``blend_out`` ramps are recorded but **not yet applied** to
  pose values in 2A — the timeline produces the raw Pose and the renderer
  decides what to do with the ramps. Additive blending lands in 2B.
