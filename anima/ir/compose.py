"""Composition combinators for authoring action trees, plus a flattener.

The composition tree is the *authoring* form. The flat list of `FlatAction`s
with absolute start times is the *canonical* form that gets verified, cached,
and rendered. Both forms round-trip through the schema; the flat form is
what tooling reasons about.
